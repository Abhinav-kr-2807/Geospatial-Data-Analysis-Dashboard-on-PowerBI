# Data Visualization Project: Geospatial Data Analysis Dashboard

## Synopsis

This repository contains the code and resources for constructing a robust Data Visualization Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard utilizes a dataset comprising demographic and educational information for 493 cities across India. The goal is to distill this data into meaningful insights that can inform decision-making in urban planning, education, and gender equality.

## Problem Statement

The objective is to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes:
- Demographic Overview
- Gender Equality Analysis
- Education Insights
- Urban Planning Support
- State-wise Correlations
- High-Impact Regions Identification
- Interactive Filters
- Geospatial Analysis
- Key Insights Summaries
- Data-Driven Decision Support

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes:
- City names, state codes, and state names
- Population demographics
- Literacy statistics
- Gender demographics
- Educational attainment
- Geospatial coordinates for mapping

## Data Preprocessing Steps

1. **Data Type Conversion:** Ensure appropriate data types.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Encode categorical features.
3. **Feature Scaling:** Normalize numeric data if required.
4. **Outlier Detection and Handling:** Address outliers.
5. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features for additional insights.
6. **Geospatial Information Arrangement:** Extract latitude and longitude coordinates.
